# CSU Game Developer's Club Farmer Template

This is a Unity 6000.0.37f1 game template file designed for use in CSU Game Developer's Club game jams, though feel free to use it no matter whenever or whoever you are! 

The template will be most useful for new or busy Unity developers but ideas can be applied universally. 

A major benefit of using this template for Game Developer's Club members is that you can always ask me questions about this in the discord (@KeinNyne).


## Features:
The template is inspired by popular indie game Stardew Valley and includes the following Features.

- Well commented code, explaining behavior
- WASD 2d character controller
- Inventory and hotbar system
- Game state management system
- Item use/behavior
- Saving and loading
- Placeholder sprites with animations (check attributions)
